# TreeClassification
This project implements a deep learning model to classify images of 30+ tree and plant species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and EfficientNetB0 with TensorFlow/Keras. The dataset contains real-world images and includes significant class imbalance, which is handled using data augmentation and class weighting.
